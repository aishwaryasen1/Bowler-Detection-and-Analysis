# Bowler-Detection-and-Analysis
Video 1 – Bowler Detection

It uses three cases – a) Front (horizontal) movement of bowler
b) Jump (vertical) motion of bowler
c) Change in angle of bowling arm
As it indicates bowler detected only if a) or b) and c) are true and that may not happen in every frame,
even the sign of “bowler detected” on 2-3 frames should be enough to identify the bowler

Video 2 – Determining the frame when bowler jumps and frame when wrist is at highest position +
coordinate of these maximum positions

On pressing the spacebar, the video will pause and the max positions of wrist and avg. ankle position as
well as frame for the same will be outputted. This can be used to determine frame for jump and release
of ball. Pressing the spacebar again will resume the video
